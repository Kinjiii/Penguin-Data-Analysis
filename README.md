# Penguin-Data-Analysis
Kaggle dataset analyzed

Summary:
The data folder contains two CSV files.

penguins_lter.csv: Original combined data for 3 penguin species.

penguins_size.csv: Simplified data from original penguin data sets. 

Contains variables:

species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, or Gentoo)

culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)

culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)

flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)

body_mass_g: body mass (g)

island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)

sex: penguin sex


What are culmen length & depth?
The culmen is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak".
For this penguin data, the culmen length and culmen depth are measured as shown below (thanks Kristen Gorman for clarifying!):

Basic data exploration & vizualization. To further improve the analysis of this dataset, I would like to develop predictive models that can accurately classify penguin species based on their physical measurements and other features. By using machine learning techniques, such as classification algorithms, we can gain deeper insights into the relationships between these variables and enhance our understanding of the penguin populations in the Palmer Archipelago. This would not only provide a practical application for the data but also offer a valuable contribution to ecological studies and conservation efforts.
