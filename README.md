# Penguin Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing information about three penguin species from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. The analysis includes basic data exploration, visualization, and sets the groundwork for predictive modeling to classify penguin species based on their physical measurements.

## Dataset
The data folder contains two CSV files:

- **`penguins_lter.csv`:** Original combined data for three penguin species.
- **`penguins_size.csv`:** Simplified version of the original data.

### Key Variables
- **`species:`** Penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo).
- **`culmen_length_mm:`** Culmen length in millimeters (mm). The culmen is the upper ridge of a bird’s beak.
- **`culmen_depth_mm:`** Culmen depth in millimeters (mm).
- **`flipper_length_mm:`** Flipper length in millimeters (mm).
- **`body_mass_g:`** Body mass in grams (g).
- **`island:`** The island where the penguin was found (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe).
- **`sex:`** Penguin sex (male or female).

### What are Culmen Length and Depth?
The culmen is the "upper ridge of a bird's beak." In this dataset, culmen length and depth are key measurements that help differentiate between penguin species.

## Analysis and Insights

### What Was Done?
1. **Basic Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   - Explored the distribution of penguin species across different islands and sexes.
   - Visualized the relationships between different measurements (culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass).
   
## Future Work
- Future work involves developing predictive models to classify penguin species based on their physical measurements and other features.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the potential of using physical measurements of penguins to build predictive models that can accurately classify species. These insights are not only valuable for academic research but also for practical conservation applications. Future model development will further our understanding of penguin populations and contribute to ecological conservation efforts.
